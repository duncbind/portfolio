| Question  | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Who do you think this presentation was made for?  | “I think this presentation was made for anyone interested in learning about drug courts. It feels like something that could be in the New York Times or Washington post.”  |    |
| What story do you think this presentation was telling you?  | “I think it was telling me that Drug Courts are worth the investment and aren't currently as invested in as prisons.”  | "This story is mainly informative on what drug courts are. They are able to cut costs and improve recidivism rates. However, I am having trouble understanding the thesis. Am I to understand that Drug Courts are inevitably accessed as well?"  |
| Did you feel the need for additional information or elaboration at any point?  | “No.”  | "Ultimately, I feel that this presentation needs a thesis/persuasive argument."  |
| Did you feel consistently engaged with the material presented?  | “Yes.”  |  I see that after the something has to change part, we are introduced to drug courts as an alternative solution. I would lean into this by creating a new section rather than keeping it part of the same continuum of discussion.   |
| Were there any elements you found distracting or confusing?  | “Not really. There are some charts that need to be updated. I would say that going from the flushed out graphs to the hand drawn ones is a little distracting, but that should be fine once they are fixed.”  | I noticed that the recidivism comment is an apples to oranges comparison. You may be able to make a stronger thesis by creating two separate bar graphs or something that shows this contrast.  |
| Did you feel inspired to take any particular action?  | “I know there are resources at the bottom. I guess I could find a drug court near me and see what their deal is.”  | "Not really. I just felt more informed about drug courts, but I would like to learn more of how they get implemented as alternative options in PA. Like is this something that I could let my HS nephew know about? (fictional character)"  |
| Would you have found this presentation more engaging if there were additional elements?  | “I am trying to think if it was a New York Times article, what it would have in it. I do like the visual stories that you do flow through like this. Sometimes they will have background pictures or media. I don't know if you need that for this topic but sometimes it is nice. Here would you have a picture of a court or a prison? I am not sure. Maybe it's better to just keep it gradient colored.”  | "Pictures! They'll save a lot of words."  |
| If you had to change one thing, what would it be?  | “I don't know if you are able to change the spacing between the sections, but maybe tighten it a little bit. Or maybe that gives it time to breathe.”  | "While I think that the racial component is an interesting observation, I think that it goes a bit outside the bounds of the overall thesis which is to introduce the reader to drug courts. It seems to be data that supports a different argument. For this reason I would cut it and focus the energy on how to increase the funding and usage of drug courts as a more cost-effective and likely humane treatment system. I would also like a little explanation of how a drug court differs from a regular court."   |
