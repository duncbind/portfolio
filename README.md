## About me...

My name is Duncan Bindbeutel (my last name rhymes with tinfoil.) I am an art manager working within the intersection of development, policy, and technology. I am currently a candidate for a Master of Arts Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I am originally from Columbia, MO but have lived in Chicago, IL and New York, NY. I am most proud of my professional endeavors where I have helped artists and creative professionals transform their complicated ideas into reality. I have worked in fabrication studios, organized film festivals, and have helped produce three different game shows to date. One time I lived on a flotilla of boats made out of found materials (garbage) that floated down the Hudson River. Another time, I worked for a coupon company, which was somehow way more stressful. My passion for ambitious creative projects is only surpassed by my adamant refusal to move pianos under any circumstances.

## What I hope to learn...

I am extremely excited to learn ways to present data in a way that captivates and engages people. I have always prided myself as a person who can communicate complicated ideas, and I think this class will be a wonderful opportunity to bolster those skills. I am eager to understand design fallacies that can lead to misunderstanding about key trends within data sets, and the best ways to avoid them. In the past I have been guilty of oversharing information while presenting data, so I look forward to finding ways I may find ways to reach specific audiences with particular ideas.
