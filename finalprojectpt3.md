Introduction
As I approached the final iteration of this presentation, I knew there were several major changes that needed to occur in order to make the story more effective. I was very happy with the majority of the data presented, and had the components for a compelling narrative, but I had to do a better job to connect the thesis to the story, and make sure the audience would have a clear course of action.

I went through and eliminated as much superfluous text as possible. If information could be converted into a citation for the sake of clarity, I did so to make things less awkward for a reader. I used color and a few other flourishes to add emphasis to key pieces of information making them more accessible for readers.

The most drastic change I made was removing the colored gradient style of the presentation in favor of images that made the story feel more human. I liked how the gradient worked, and am glad I now have that technique in my tool belt, but it made the story feel far too sterile. This is a story about helping people, and so the audience would need to see people within the narrative in order to feel moved to action.



I realized I was being a bit biased for showing simple figures in numerical form. While not dishonest, I had received feedback that there were plenty of opportunities to show things visually that I was not taking advantage of. Converting these figures into easily comparable charts, and adding a compelling visual element really transformed the information into something more captivating, and thus more likely to inspire action from the audience.




Based on my feedback it was very apparent I needed to clarify my call to action at the end of the presentation. It didn't make sense to include an option to find a drug court near you, because my target audience is not likely to need a drug court themselves. Rather they would either need to advocate for the existence of a drug court in their community, or support them on a national level. I opted to switch out the option to “Find a Drug Court Near You” with “Donate to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals,” and list the option to donate as the first option.



The final version of this story can be found here. In the process of its creation, I found the initial feedback from my peers to be incredibly valuable. One can design and rationalize many components of stories such as these, but it is impossible to understand their efficacy if you do not solicit feedback from interested yet unbiased parties. 

Thank you very much for joining me on this journey!
