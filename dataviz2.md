With this first visualization, I wanted to cater the data presentation to a wide audience with a general understating of the concept. For this visual, it is most important to convey trends than granular details, but some of that information is still available. If you hold a cursor over any of the data points, you will get the date and the numerical value for the Debt-to-GDP ratio. While this visual gives the reader an idea of the data for individual countries, it is not designed to be easily facilitate comparisons between them. I wanted the labels on the X and Y axis to be visible but not distracting, so I kept them along the very bottom and far left charts and used a very light but still legible grey to keep the reader from being too distracted by them. Additionally, I used a shade of yellow called Poseidon’s Gold to represent the data. I like this color a lot because it pops out of a white/grey field but is not too visually overwhelming to the viewer.

For this chart I wanted to cater the information to a much more specific audience. I decided to narrow the Countries represented to the G-7 Member States because that seemed like a group that would have very strong economic ties to one another. Furthermore, I decided emphasizing the data from the United States in comparison to other states would further narrow the audience and enable some insightful comparisons. I didn’t want the viewer to become too distracted, so I only assigned color to the line representing US data and left the remainder grey. I did want to leave room for the viewer to compare data between specific nations, so I included an option to select one or more nations data to isolate. Finally, I wanted to acknowledge that while United Kingdom is a member of G-7, the data that was available to me had separate listings for Great Britain and Ireland, so I included both separately and left a not at the bottom noting this decision.
