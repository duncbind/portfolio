## Introduction

The next step in developing this project is to create a wireframe, or rough approximation of what the final presentation will look like, and solicit some actionable feedback. I was able to render some of my more robust data sets into some dynamic visuals using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), and while I feel they represent the data appropriately, I was still very eager to see how an audience would engage with them and what revisions they would be eager to see. The wireframe still utilized some of my sketches from the last section to convey some necessary information. While hand drawn, these sketches do reflect actual data, so the represented statistics will not be misleading to any of the individuals I will be soliciting feedback from.

While building out this story in [Shorthand](https://app.shorthand.com/)
 I wanted to avoid being too visually overwhelming. There are a lot of amazing options to integrate media in a presentation with Shorthand, but my fear was that if I overdid it, it might detract from the purpose of the presentation. I opted to use a gradient background that moved slightly as you scrolled through the story. I wanted the background to shift from red to blue and eventually white to match the narrative shift from crisis and urgency, to an informed call to action.

## Feedback

My target audience for this presentation is community organizers with varying levels of influence, from local to regional, who have an understanding of the effects of addiction and incarceration in their respective communities. To solicit feedback I sought out two individuals who were engaged in their communities, had deep understanding of the societal effects of both addiction and incarceration, and had little or no familiarity with drug courts as a viable option for addressing these issues.

Person 1 is a newer resident of Western Pennsylvania, identifies as a moderate liberal, and works in data science. They are an active volunteer and regular voter, but they are hesitant to trust government bureaucracies to fix complex societal issues.

Person number 2 is a lifelong resident of Allegheny county, identifies as a liberal democrat,  and works as a graphic designer. As a lifelong resident with deep roots in the community, they have seen many problems affecting Western Pennsylvania throughout their lives, and are eager to hear potential solutions.

I gave both participants a link to the wireframe of the presentation, and let them read through it without any explanation. Upon completion, I gave them the same series of questions, occasionally asking a follow up to elicit a more elaborate response if it seemed they had more to say. 


| Question  | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Who do you think this presentation was made for?  | “I think this presentation was made for anyone interested in learning about drug courts. It feels like something that could be in the New York Times or Washington post.”  | "People who don't know about drug courts."   |
| What story do you think this presentation was telling you?  | “I think it was telling me that Drug Courts are worth the investment and aren't currently as invested in as prisons.”  | "This story is mainly informative on what drug courts are. They are able to cut costs and improve recidivism rates. However, I am having trouble understanding the thesis. Am I to understand that Drug Courts are unevenly accessed as well?"  |
| Did you feel the need for additional information or elaboration at any point?  | “No.”  | "Ultimately, I feel that this presentation needs a thesis/persuasive argument."  |
| Did you feel consistently engaged with the material presented?  | “Yes.”  |  "I see that after the something has to change part, we are introduced to drug courts as an alternative solution. I would lean into this by creating a new section rather than keeping it part of the same continuum of discussion."   |
| Were there any elements you found distracting or confusing?  | “Not really. There are some charts that need to be updated. I would say that going from the flushed out graphs to the hand drawn ones is a little distracting, but that should be fine once they are fixed.”  | I noticed that the recidivism comment is an apples to oranges comparison. You may be able to make a stronger thesis by creating two separate bar graphs or something that shows this contrast.  |
| Did you feel inspired to take any particular action?  | “I know there are resources at the bottom. I guess I could find a drug court near me and see what their deal is.”  | "Not really. I just felt more informed about drug courts, but I would like to learn more of how they get implemented as alternative options in PA. Like is this something that I could let my HS nephew know about? (fictional character)"  |
| Would you have found this presentation more engaging if there were additional elements?  | “I am trying to think if it was a New York Times article, what it would have in it. I do like the visual stories that you do flow through like this. Sometimes they will have background pictures or media. I don't know if you need that for this topic but sometimes it is nice. Here would you have a picture of a court or a prison? I am not sure. Maybe it's better to just keep it gradient colored.”  | "Pictures! They'll save a lot of words."  |
| If you had to change one thing, what would it be?  | “I don't know if you are able to change the spacing between the sections, but maybe tighten it a little bit. Or maybe that gives it time to breathe.”  | "While I think that the racial component is an interesting observation, I think that it goes a bit outside the bounds of the overall thesis which is to introduce the reader to drug courts. It seems to be data that supports a different argument. For this reason I would cut it and focus the energy on how to increase the funding and usage of drug courts as a more cost-effective and likely humane treatment system. I would also like a little explanation of how a drug court differs from a regular court."   |

## Peer Reveiw
I was also fortunate enough to have some of my peers from my class read my wireframe and provide me with feedback. I had a few guiding questions I asked, but also received feedback as they went through the presentation on their own. I included the most relevant feedback with the question that best corresponded with their insights...

### Is the presentation easy to understand?

> “It would be more helpful, for people whose second language is English, to show an introductory image.”

> “Having the images will show the story better than not having them.”



### Did you feel engaged?

> “You have made this easy to read through, and because of that there is less trimming you will have to do… Something I would like to see addressed more granularly is the Federal Appropriations. You should have the actual number that is represented by the dollar symbol.

### Do the Use of data and visualizations support the presentation?


> “Maybe present what is being done to make the improvements happen. That way I might be inclined to support an effort that I am being informed about.”

> “You could probably do a visualization of $27 to $1 investment and savings. Similar to the 75% and 66%. This is a good opportunity to use shapes instead of numbers.”

> “I would still like to see persona images, or atleast what a drug courtroom looks like.”

### Is there a clear call to action or next steps?


> “Yeah, donate or give money to somebody!”


## Actionable Steps


After reviewing all the feedback, I broke down what would be most feasible and beneficial into basic categories based on the effort it would take to implement them, and the return on investment.


| Rank | High Effort, High Return |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1| Review each portion of the story, and make sure it is consistently driving towards an understandable, actionable thesis. |
|     2| Refine the call to action further, leave no question about one thing everyone who sees this presentation can do to support drug court. |
|     3| Update all hand drawn elements with more sophisticated data visuals. |
|     4| Source new data and create visuals that contribute to the refined narrative. |




| Rank | Low Effort, High Return |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1| Omit sections that are contrary to the thesis, and confuse the call to action. |
|     2| Add images of people who have been affected by drug court, incarceration, and addiction to make drug court seem more tangible and the story more human. |
|     3| Make the transitions of the Shorthand format smoother, with less negative space between segments. |
|     4| Embellish text segments that include data that does not warrant an entire chart. |
