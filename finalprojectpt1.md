## The Data

Current percentage of federal inmates based on offenses Source: [Federal Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp)


*This data will be used to demonstrate the sheer volume of federally incarcerated individuals who are imprisoned because of drug charges. By priming the audience with this information they will hopefully view the rest of the data visuals with this volume in mind, and that even success rates of 8% - 25% would remove a huge portion of individuals from the federal prison system.

*These data sets will be compared to show the huge discrepancy between what is allocated towards incarceration, and what is put towards Drug Courts. While this will make for an intesteing comparison, I hope to find more overlapping years of Appropriation Data to further illustrate this point.

*This data will be used to demonstrate the expanse and wide reach of Drug court. This will provide the audience with the context that these courts are not niche, but have been successful in many areas, rural and urban, throughout the United States.

*This Data will be good for conclusive individual statistics on the efficacy of Drug Court. While these are good individual pieces of data to send an audience home with, it will be worthwhile to continue to search for more robust data sets on Drug Court success in order to demonstrate historical trends, or cross reference with other data from specific time periods.
