## Introduction


It is my goal with this project to provide advocacy for Drug Courts in the United States. My intended Audience will range from policy makers, to justice advocates, to community organizers who would benefit from these court systems and the positive impact they have on their community. To do this, I will attempt to provide robust data that is presented in a memorable and visually appealing manner. The goal of this will be that individuals will walk away with an understanding of the efficacy of the program, as well as notable data segments that they will be able to share among peers with minimal need to reference the report at a later date. Additionally, it is my hope that each audience member leaves the presentation as an advocate for Drug Court, and other alternative sentencing courts.


## Outline
 
1. Provide necessary context on the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.  
* Drug addiction as a public health issue.  
* Majority of people who are incarcerated in federal prison are there on drug charges.  
* Incarceration has little effect on this phenomenonLeads to recidivism.Is punitive instead of corrective.  
* A different approach is required.  
2. Introduce the concept of alternative sentencing courts, specifically Drug Court.  
* Discuss success in the past 20 years.  
* The increase in the amount of courts throughout the United States.  
* Address how much more cost effective it is over incarceration.  
* How the Drug Court model is adaptable to other courts, (Mental Health, Veteran, Juvenile, etc.)  
3. Call to action.  
* Voice support for alternative courts to your representatives.  
* Share a button to provide info on drug courts near you.  
* Share a button that enables audience members to contact local policy makers to continue to support Drug Court.

## The Data

Current percentage of federal inmates based on offenses - Source: [Federal Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp)


* This data will be used to demonstrate the sheer volume of federally incarcerated individuals who are imprisoned because of drug charges. By priming the audience with this information they will hopefully view the rest of the data visuals with this volume in mind, and that even success rates of 8% - 25% would remove a huge portion of individuals from the federal prison system.

* These data sets will be compared to show the huge discrepancy between what is allocated towards incarceration, and what is put towards Drug Courts. While this will make for an intesteing comparison, I hope to find more overlapping years of Appropriation Data to further illustrate this point.

* This data will be used to demonstrate the expanse and wide reach of Drug court. This will provide the audience with the context that these courts are not niche, but have been successful in many areas, rural and urban, throughout the United States.

* This Data will be good for conclusive individual statistics on the efficacy of Drug Court. While these are good individual pieces of data to send an audience home with, it will be worthwhile to continue to search for more robust data sets on Drug Court success in order to demonstrate historical trends, or cross reference with other data from specific time periods.

## Method and Medium


I will be forming my final project with Shorthand, as I have found it has several valuable tools that can present my narrative in a visually stimulating way without detracting from the substance of the materials.  Individual data visuals will likely be created with Flourish, but ones that require more nuance or intricately presented information with multiple variables or geographic information will be constructed in Tableau. Supplementary images will be sourced from Unsplash, or other sites that provide free high resolution photos. Data and visuals will all be presented along with citations so that original authors shall receive due credit.
